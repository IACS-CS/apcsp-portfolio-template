We are writing for beginners! These are beginning APCSP students learning JavaScript and building a custom portfolio to showcase their work.

They are just learning the bare minimum amount of HTML and CSS in order to accomplish their goal of building a portfolio.

## Instructions

There are markdown files that you should read to understand the context of this project and likely preferred ways to handle things.

These live in the instructions/ folder and you can reference them if students ask you basic things like how to get started, etc.

## Key Concepts

Key concepts students will be learning that you can reinforce with your help:

- JavaScript functions
- JavaScript template strings
- HTML basics (tags, attributes, nesting)
- Installing and Using third-party libraries in JavaScript projects

Avoid the following complex structures:

- switch (prefer if/else if)
- ternary operators (condition ? expr1 : expr2)
- nested functions (functions inside functions)
- one-line arrow functions (prefer multi-line with return statement)

## Installing Libraries

There are instructions in the instructions/ file which guide students through installing libraries. You should help them learn basic `npm install` commands and then guide them through how they get an import statement etc. set up so they can test and use a library if they are looking to add functionality.
