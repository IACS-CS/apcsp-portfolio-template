# Portfolio Project

Welcome to the Portfolio Project!

This is a modern website template built with **vanilla JavaScript** and **Vite**. You’ll learn how to build a portfolio using modular JavaScript, reusable utility functions, and simple hash-based routing (URLs like `#/binary-search`).

## Goals

- Build a published portfolio to highlight your coding work.
- Learn the fundamentals of how a website is designed and structured.
- Learn how to use open source libraries to enhance your site.
- Practice code reuse and the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle using JS modules and utility functions.
- Learn the basics of licensing models.

## Requirements

- Create a portfolio with at least 3 pages, using JS modules for each page.
- Customize the look and feel of your page so it is unique.
- Use at least one library you researched independently to enhance your website.
- Include an "acknowledgements" page with a list of libraries and sources you used.
- Include a copyright statement with a license.
